# Advanced Material Settings

Advanced material settings provide additional customization options for fine-tuning the behavior of different materials in your 3D printing projects. These settings allow you to optimize print quality, adhesion, and overall performance based on the specific characteristics of each material.

## Filament start G-code

These settings allow you to define custom G-code commands that will be executed at the start of a print using a specific material. This can be useful for priming the nozzle, purging old filament, or performing any other necessary actions before printing.

## Filament end G-code

These settings allow you to define custom G-code commands that will be executed at the start and end of a print using a specific material. This can be useful for priming the nozzle, purging old filament, or performing any other necessary actions before or after printing.
